\subsection*{Section 0.2}
\subsection*{Problem 1}

Prove the following equivalences:

a) $\lnot (P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \lnot Q)$

We can write a truth table that lists the truth values of
$\lnot (P \lor Q)$ and $(\neg P \land \lnot Q)$ for all truth values of $P$ and $Q$:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
P & Q & \lnot P & \lnot Q & P \lor Q & \lnot (P \lor Q) & (\lnot P \land \lnot Q) \\
\hline
T & T & F & F & T & \bf F & \bf F \\
T & F & F & T & T & \bf F & \bf F \\
F & T & T & F & T & \bf F & \bf F \\
F & F & T & T & F & \bf T & \bf T \\
\end{array}
$$

Since the two statements have the same truth value in all cases, they are equivalent.

b) $\lnot (P \land Q) \equiv (\lnot P \lor \lnot Q)$

We can write a truth value to test every case:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
P & Q & \lnot P & \lnot Q & P \land Q & \lnot (P \land Q) & (\lnot P \lor \lnot Q) \\
\hline
T & T & F & F & T & \bf F & \bf F \\
T & F & F & T & F & \bf T & \bf T \\
F & T & T & F & F & \bf T & \bf T \\
F & F & T & T & F & \bf T & \bf T \\
\end{array}
$$

Since both statements have the same truth value for any value of $P$ or $Q$, they
are equivalent.

\subsection*{Problem 2}

Prove that $P \implies Q \equiv (\lnot P) \lor Q$. Deduce that the negation of
$P \implies Q$ is $P \land (\lnot Q)$.

We write a truth table to show that $P \implies Q$ has the same truth value as
$(\lnot P)\lor Q$ in all cases:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
P & Q & \lnot P & (\lnot P) \lor Q & P \implies Q \\
\hline
T & T & F & \bf T & \bf T \\
T & F & F & \bf F & \bf F \\
F & T & T & \bf T & \bf T \\
F & F & T & \bf T & \bf T \\
\end{array}
$$

Since $P \implies Q$ is equivalent to $(\lnot P) \lor Q$, their negations will be
equivalent. So we negate  $(\lnot P) \lor Q$ and manipulate using equivalences from
Problem 1 to find the negation:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\lnot (P \implies Q) &= \lnot (\lnot P \lor Q) \\
&= \lnot(\lnot P \lor \lnot (\lnot Q)) \\
&= \lnot (\lnot (P \land (\lnot Q))) \\
&= P \land (\lnot Q).
\end{array}
$$

We also used the fact that $\lnot (\lnot P) \equiv P$, which we now show with a
truth table:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
P & \lnot P & \lnot (\lnot P) \\
\hline
\bf T & F & \bf T \\
\bf F & T & \bf F \\
\end{array}
$$

\subsection*{Problem 3}

Find the negation of the following statements.

a) $\lnot(P \land \lnot Q) \lor R$

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\lnot (\lnot(P \land \lnot Q) \lor R) &= (P \land \lnot Q) \land \lnot R \\
&= P \land \lnot Q \land \lnot R.
\end{array}
$$

b) $P \implies (Q \lor R)$

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\lnot (P \implies (Q \lor R)) &= P \land \lnot (Q \lor R) \\
&= P \land \lnot Q \land \lnot R.
\end{array}
$$

c) $\lnot (P \lor Q) \implies (R \lor S)$

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\lnot (\lnot (P \lor Q) \implies (R \lor S))
&= \lnot ((P \lor Q) \lor (R \lor S)) \\
&= \lnot (P \lor Q) \land \lnot (R \lor S) \\
&= \lnot P \land \lnot Q \land \lnot R \land \lnot S.
\end{array}
$$
\subsection*{Problem 5}

Prove that an implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.

The contrapositive of $P \implies Q$ is the statement
$\lnot Q \implies \lnot P$. We can manipulate the statement $\lnot P \lor Q$, noting
that it is equivalent to $P \implies Q$:
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\lnot P \lor Q &= Q \lor \lnot P \\
&= \lnot (\lnot Q) \lor \lnot P \\
&= \lnot Q \implies \lnot P.
\end{array}
$$

\subsection*{Problem 6}
An example of an implication whose converse is not true:

If polygon $ABCD$ is a square, then its interior angles are all 90 degrees.

An example of an implcation whose converse is true:
\[ (x = 4) \implies (x+2 = 6) \]
\subsection*{Problem 7}
Negate the following statements:

a) For every ice cream flavor there is a pie that goes with that flavor

There exists an ice cream flavor for which there are no pies that go with it.

b) For every race car there is a driver who can drive that car.

There exists at least one race car with no driver who can drive it.

c) There exists a race car that every driver can drive.

For each race car there exists at least one driver who cannot drive it.

d) There exists a driver that can drive every race car.

For all race car drivers there exists at least one car they cannot drive.

\subsection*{Section 0.3}
\subsection*{Problem 1}

Let $A, B \subseteq X$. Which of the statements is equivalent to 
$A \cup B \neq \varnothing $?

Answer: (b) $A \neq \varnothing \lor B \neq \varnothing $.
For the union of $A$ and $B$ to be nonempty it is sufficient for at least one of $A$ or $B$
to be nonempty.

\subsection*{Problem 2}

Let $A, B \subseteq X$. Which of the statements is equivalent to
$A \cap B = \varnothing $?

Answer: (b) $A = \varnothing \lor B = \varnothing$.
If any one of $A$ or $B$ is empty, then their intersection will be empty.

\subsection*{Problem 3}
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Prove that $A = (A \cap B) \cup (A \setminus B)$.

We consider the definitions of $A \cap B$ and $A \setminus B$. The set $A \cap B$
is the set of all elements of $A$ that are also in $B$. The set $A \setminus B$ is the
set of all elements of $A$ that are not in $B$. The union of these two sets,
$(A \cap B) \cup (A \setminus B)$, is the set of all elements of $A$ that are also
in $B$ or that are not also in $B$. Since everything is either in $B$ or not in $B$,
this set contains all elements of $A$. Thus, $A = (A \cap B) \cup (A \setminus B)$. 

\subsection*{Problem 4}

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Prove that $A \setminus (A \setminus B) = B$.

The premise is actually false. Let $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{2, 3\}$. We can see that
$A \setminus B = \{1\}$ and that $A \setminus \{1\} = \{2\} \neq \{2, 3\}$.

If instead the condition had been added that $B \subseteq A$, it would have been a good
problem.

\subsection*{Problem 5}

Let $A, B \subseteq X$. Prove that $A \subseteq B \iff B^c \subseteq A^c$.

We first prove that $A \subseteq B \implies B^c \subseteq A^c$. $A \subseteq B$ means that
all elements of $A$ are also in $B$. Also, by definition, $x \in B^c \implies x \notin B$. 
So, $\forall x \notin B^c$, $x$ cannot be in $A$, which means that $x \in A^c$. Thus, 
$B^c \subseteq A^c$. 

We now prove the other direction, that $B^c \subseteq A^c \implies A \subseteq B$.
Note that any $x \in B^c$ is also in $A^c$. In other words, $x$ cannot be in $B^c$ and
also be in $A$. So, any element of $A$ is also in $B$, which means $A \subseteq B$.

\subsection*{Problem 17}

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets such that $A \subseteq B$. Prove that $\P (A) \subseteq \P (B)$.

Let $S$ be any element of $\P (A)$. By the definition of $\P (A)$, $S \subseteq A$.
Since $A \subseteq B$, every element of $S$ is in $B$ as well, so $S \subseteq B$.
Hence, $S \in \P (B)$. So, every $S \in \P (A)$ is also in $\P (B)$, which means
$\P (A) \subseteq \P (B)$. 

\subsection*{Section 0.4}
\subsection*{Problem 10}

Let $f: X \to Y$ be a function.

a) Prove that $f(f^{-1}(B)) \subseteq B$ for all $B \subseteq Y$.

Take any $y \in f(f^{-1}(B))$. This means that $y=f(x)$ for some $x \in f^{-1}(B)$.
By the definition of $f^{-1}(B)$, $f(x) \in B$, so $y \in B$. Thus,
$f(f^{-1}(B)) \subseteq B$. 

b) Prove that $f(f^{-1}(B)) = B$ when $f$ is surjective.

We have already shown that $f(f^{-1}(B)) \subseteq B$ in general, so it is also true
if $f$ is surjective. We will show that if $f$ is surjective, then 
$B \subseteq f(f^{-1}(B))$, and thus that $f(f^{-1}(B)) = B$. For $f$ to be surjective,
it is necessary that for all $y \in Y$ there exists some $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.
In particular, for all $y \in B$ there exists an $x \in f^{-1}(B)$ where $f(x) = y$.
Hence, $y \in f(f^{-1}(B))$ for any $y \in B$. So, when $f$ is surjective,
$B \subseteq f(f^{-1}(B))$, and thus $B = f(f^{-1}(B))$.

\subsection*{Problem 17}

Let $f: X \to Y$ be a function. Prove that $f(A\cup B) = f(A) \cup f(B)$ for all
$A, B \in X$.
